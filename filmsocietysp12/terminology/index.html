<p><strong>Necessary Film Terminology for Writing Analytically about Film<br />
</strong></p>

<p>Key Point: Filmmakers use camera placement, lenses, angles, distances, etc., to establish physical and psychological relationships between object and viewer. This is how meaning and themes are communicated to the viewer.</p>

<p><strong>Lenses &#38; Effects</strong></p>

<p><em>Wide-Angle Lens</em> <br />
places most or all focal planes on the screen in focus for the viewer--that is, more objects come into focus. This lens also exaggerates depth within the frame, and it may even distort images or boundaries within the frame when used for a medium or close-up shot. Also, the sense of movement within the frame increases.</p>

<p><em>Telephoto Lens </em><br />
reduces the depth and volume of images within the frame. This lens usually isolates a single image in focus, leaving the rest of the focal planes within the frame in less focus (i.e., the opposite effect of the wide-angle lens).</p>

<p><em>Normal Lens </em><br />
is the closest lens to approximate the perspective of the human eye. This lens avoids any kind of distortion (exaggerating depth as in the wide-angle lens, and flattening distance as with the telephoto lens).</p>

<p><em>Fish-Eye Lens</em><br />
a super wide-angle lens that gives a sense of curvature to the image/frame.</p>

<p><em>Rack-to-Focus</em><br />
a shift in focus from the foreground to the middle of the frame.</p>

<p><em>Deep Focus</em><br />
is a means of framing in depth that relies upon a wide-angle lens (i.e., clarity is noticeable in several planes).</p>

<p><em>Deep Space</em><br />
refers to composition of the frame; it deals with how focal planes are arranged in depth in a shot, not with the clarity of their appearance. In other words, deep space does not refer to clarity of focus of objects in frame.</p>

<p><strong>Camera Distance: Shots &#38; Creating the Scene</strong><br />
(Note: Camera shots are created in reference to the human body.)</p>

<p><em>Close-Up Shot</em><br />
Usually a focused view of the character's head or face, cut off from the environment. Creates a strong sense of intimacy or empathy with a character. Provides a detailed study of a character's psychological reaction.</p>

<p><em>Extreme Close-Up Shot</em><br />
usually singles out a portion of the face and isolates/magnifies it in detail.<br />
Long Shot: shows full human figures, head to foot, in clear visible surroundings and spatial relationships. The background tends to dominate the frame, in contrast to the close up.</p>

<p><em>Medium Shot</em><br />
shows the actor from the waist up. It often creates a comfortable or strained intimacy for the audience.</p>

<p><em>The "American Shot" (Plan Americain)</em><br />
shows the actor from the knees to the top of the head, moving in defined space.</p>

<p><em>Medium Close-up Shot</em><br />
frames the body from the chest to the top of the head.</p>

<p><em>Over-the-Shoulder Shot</em><br />
often provides the aesthetic feel of a two shot (i.e., a frame containing two people) while focusing on one person's reaction.</p>

<p><strong>Camera Angles</strong><br />
(Key Point: The angle at which we view an object affects how we react or feel towards the characters.)</p>

<p><em>High Angle</em><br />
looks down, creates an aloof, superior, detached, or indifferent point of view.</p>

<p><em>Extreme High-Angle Shot</em><br />
a straight-down angle, creates a dehumanizing effect because it's the least familiar way for us to look at another person.</p>

<p><em>Mid-Angle</em><br />
looks across from object, creates effect that viewer is placed equally with character. Creates space for sympathy or understanding.</p>

<p><em>Low-Angle</em><br />
looks up, creates feeling of helplessness or intimidation in face of something powerful or dominant.</p>

<p><em>Canted Angle, or the "Dutch Angle"</em><br />
camera is offset, creating a topsy-turvy worldview, stressing the unfamiliar or the disorienting.</p>

<p><em>Subjective Angle</em><br />
is a point of view angle; it represents the point of view of another character, as if the camera is the eyes of the character.</p>

<p><strong>Framing</strong></p>

<p><em>Masking</em><br />
covering up part of the frame/image that the viewer sees. This act changes our sight of the frame, which in turn changes the meaning of what we see and how to interpret the characters' actions.</p>

<p><em>Iris</em><br />
a special technique of masking that creates an eye-shaped (oval) focus to single out and place emphasis upon a particular part of the frame. The iris usually signals that the shot we see is a purely subjective point of view.</p>

<p><strong>Camera Movement</strong></p>

<p><em>Pan</em><br />
a slow horizontal pivoting of a camera fixed in one place.</p>

<p><em>Tracking Shot</em><br />
linear movement of camera alongside a moving object or scene-camera moves, not stationary.</p>

<p><em>Tilt Shot</em><br />
shows slow vertical pivoting of camera; implies aspiration, thoughtfulness, or curiosity.</p>

<p><em>Crane</em><br />
a vertical or diagonal movement up and down, enables viewer inspection of large objects.</p>

<p><em>Dolly</em><br />
smooth rolling movement of camera either into or out of a field of vision; implies curiosity gratified, spatial intrusion, or lack of interest.</p>

<p><strong>Camera Speed</strong></p>

<p><em>Slow Motion</em><br />
used to create dreamlike vision, lyrical, entrapping, confined or other emotional qualities or states.</p>

<p><strong>Lighting</strong><br />
(Key Point: Lighting creates what we see and also defines what and how we see it.)</p>

<p><em>Natural Light</em><br />
sunlight, moonlight, outside lights that are not arranged.</p>

<p><em>Artificial Light</em><br />
light that we arrange and contrive/create or simulate.</p>

<p><em>Key Light</em><br />
main source of light in a scene; comes from one side or another.</p>

<p><em>Filler</em><br />
a balancing light used to eliminate shadows created by key light; often directed at a star's face to <br />
provide a balanced lighted perspective.</p>

<p><em>Back Light</em><br />
illuminates the back of a scene and the head and back of a subject; often creates a "halo effect" around the head and shoulders of the subject.</p>

<p><em>Hard Lighting</em><br />
sharply contrasts illuminated and shadowed areas; suggests mystery, ominous situations, fear, used a lot in film noir.</p>

<p><em>Soft Lighting</em><br />
creates an evenly lit world, where things are known or soon-to-be known. Usually militates against the generation of suspense or fear, and does not create strong moral distinctions between characters.<br />
